      <p>
        Germs are all around us, both in our environment and in our bodies. When
        a person is susceptible and they encounter a harmful organism, it can
        lead to disease and death.
      </p>
      <p>
        The body has many ways of defending itself against pathogens
        (disease-causing organisms). Skin, mucus, and cilia (microscopic hairs
        that move debris away from the lungs) all work as physical barriers to
        prevent pathogens from entering the body in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
        When a pathogen does infect the body, our body’s defences, called the
        immune system, are triggered and the pathogen is attacked and destroyed
        or overcome.
      </p>
      <h4>The body's natural response</h4>
      <p>
        A pathogen is a bacterium, virus, parasite or fungus that can cause
        disease within the body. Each pathogen is made up of several subparts,
        usually unique to that specific pathogen and the disease it causes. The
        subpart of a pathogen that causes the formation of antibodies is called
        an antigen. The antibodies produced in response to the pathogen’s
        antigen are an important part of the immune system. You can consider
        antibodies as the soldiers in your body’s defense system. Each antibody,
        or soldier, in our system is trained to recognize one specific antigen.
        We have thousands of different antibodies in our bodies. When the human
        body is exposed to an antigen for the first time, it takes time for the
        immune system to respond and produce antibodies specific to that
        antigen.
      </p>
      <p>In the meantime, the person is susceptible to becoming ill. </p>
      <p>
        Once the antigen-specific antibodies are produced, they work with the
        rest of the immune system to destroy the pathogen and stop the disease.
        Antibodies to one pathogen generally don’t protect against another
        pathogen except when two pathogens are very similar to each other, like
        cousins. Once the body produces antibodies in its primary response to an
        antigen, it also creates antibody-producing memory cells, which remain
        alive even after the pathogen is defeated by the antibodies. If the body
        is exposed to the same pathogen more than once, the antibody response is
        much faster and more effective than the first time around because the
        memory cells are at the ready to pump out antibodies against that
        antigen.
      </p>
      <h4>How vaccines help</h4>
      <p>
        Vaccines contain weakened or inactive parts of a particular organism
        (antigen) that triggers an immune response within the body. Newer
        vaccines contain the blueprint for producing antigens rather than the
        antigen itself. Regardless of whether the vaccine is made up of the
        antigen itself or the blueprint so that the body will produce the
        antigen, this weakened version will not cause the disease in the person
        receiving the vaccine, but it will prompt their immune system to respond
        much as it would have on its first reaction to the actual pathogen.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some vaccines require multiple doses, given weeks or months apart. This
        is sometimes needed to allow for the production of long-lived antibodies
        and development of memory cells. In this way, the body is trained to
        fight the specific disease-causing organism, building up memory of the
        pathogen so as to rapidly fight it if and when exposed in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
        When someone is vaccinated, they are very likely to be protected against
        the targeted disease. But not everyone can be vaccinated. People with
        underlying health conditions that weaken their immune systems (such as
        cancer or HIV) or who have severe allergies to some vaccine components
        may not be able to get vaccinated with certain vaccines. These people
        can still be protected if they live in and amongst others who are
        vaccinated. When a lot of people in a community are vaccinated the
        pathogen has a hard time circulating because most of the people it
        encounters are immune. So the more that others are vaccinated, the less
        likely people who are unable to be protected by vaccines are at risk of
        even being exposed to the harmful pathogens. This is called herd
        immunity.
