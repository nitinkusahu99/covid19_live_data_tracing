      <p>
        Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a
        newly discovered coronavirus.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to
        moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special
        treatment. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like
        cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and
        cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.
      </p>
      <p>
        The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well
        informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes and how it
        spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your
        hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your
        face.
      </p>
      <p>
        The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or
        discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes, so
        itâ€™s important that you also practice respiratory etiquette (for
        example, by coughing into a flexed elbow).
