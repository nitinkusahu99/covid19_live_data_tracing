When\n        a person is susceptible and they encounter a harmful organism, it can\n        lead to disease and death.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        The body has many ways of defending itself against pathogens\n        (disease-causing organisms). Skin, mucus, and cilia (microscopic hairs\n        that move debris away from the lungs) all work as physical barriers to\n        prevent pathogens from entering the body in the first place.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        When a pathogen does infect the body, our body’s defences, called the\n        immune system, are triggered and the pathogen is attacked and destroyed\n        or overcome.\n      </p>\n      <h4>The body's natural response</h4>\n      <p>\n        A pathogen is a bacterium, virus, parasite or fungus that can cause\n        disease within the body. Each pathogen is made up of several subparts,\n        usually unique to that specific pathogen and the disease it causes. The\n        subpart of a pathogen that causes the formation of antibodies is called\n        an antigen. The antibodies produced in response to the pathogen’s\n        antigen are an important part of the immune system. You can consider\n        antibodies as the soldiers in your body’s defense system. Each antibody,\n        or soldier, in our system is trained to recognize one specific antigen.\n        We have thousands of different antibodies in our bodies. When the human\n        body is exposed to an antigen for the first time, it takes time for the\n        immune system to respond and produce antibodies specific to that\n        antigen.\n      </p>\n      <p>In the meantime, the person is susceptible to becoming ill. </p>\n      <p>\n        Once the antigen-specific antibodies are produced, they work with the\n        rest of the immune system to destroy the pathogen and stop the disease.\n        Antibodies to one pathogen generally don’t protect against another\n        pathogen except when two pathogens are very similar to each other, like\n        cousins. Once the body produces antibodies in its primary response to an\n        antigen, it also creates antibody-producing memory cells, which remain\n        alive even after the pathogen is defeated by the antibodies. If the body\n        is exposed to the same pathogen more than once, the antibody response is\n        much faster and more effective than the first time around because the\n        memory cells are at the ready to pump out antibodies against that\n        antigen.\n      </p>\n      <h4>How vaccines help</h4>\n      <p>\n        Vaccines contain weakened or inactive parts of a particular organism\n        (antigen) that triggers an immune response within the body. Newer\n        vaccines contain the blueprint for producing antigens rather than the\n        antigen itself. Regardless of whether the vaccine is made up of the\n        antigen itself or the blueprint so that the body will produce the\n        antigen, this weakened version will not cause the disease in the person\n        receiving the vaccine, but it will prompt their immune system to respond\n        much as it would have on its first reaction to the actual pathogen.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Some vaccines require multiple doses, given weeks or months apart. This\n        is sometimes needed to allow for the production of long-lived antibodies\n        and development of memory cells. In this way, the body is trained to\n        fight the specific disease-causing organism, building up memory of the\n        pathogen so as to rapidly fight it if and when exposed in the future.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        When someone is vaccinated, they are very likely to be protected against\n        the targeted disease. But not everyone can be vaccinated. People with\n        underlying health conditions that weaken their immune systems (such as\n        cancer or HIV) or who have severe allergies to some vaccine components\n        may not be able to get vaccinated with certain vaccines. These people\n        can still be protected if they live in and amongst others who are\n        vaccinated. When a lot of people in a community are vaccinated the\n        pathogen has a hard time circulating because most of the people it\n        encounters are immune. So the more that others are vaccinated, the less\n        likely people who are unable to be protected by vaccines are at risk of\n        even being exposed to the harmful pathogens. This is called herd\n        immunity.\n      </p>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default VaccineInfo\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
